<p>This calibration will help you to
choose the right temperature in respect of bonding, overhangs and oozing. Note that
 this test is dependant of the cooling you selected. You can print this multiple time with
more or less cooling to find the sweet spot.</p>

<p>This test will print a tower, printed with a different temperature setting for each
 floor. You should set select the filament type before generating the tower. The base will be
 printed with the  temperature settings form the filament. The first floor will be printed
with the highest chosen temperature. The temperature will be decreased by the chosen
delta for each floor.</p>

<h2>Results / observation</h2>
<p>The goal is to choose the highest temperature possible that doesn't produce artifacts.</p>
<p>First, you have to analyse the tower. Each floor has the temperature written on it.</p>

<p>Here you can see that the floor printed with 210 degree celsius is the hottest we can print
 without disintegration problems (regarding the heat; the bad quality in the pictures is due
 to high speed). You should try to break the part. In these pictures a chunk of the 195
 degree floor was broken off because of missing layer adhesion.</p>
<h2>Results: destruction</h2>
<p>Finally, you want to tear the tower apart to see if the lower temperatures have adverse
effects on layer bonding. It shouldn't be possible to tear layers apart with your bare hands.
If a floor can be easily delayered, then this floor temperature is definitely too low (or you
have had too much cooling due to the fan blowing too much), so you should choose a higher
temperature or try again with less cooling. When trying to break one, don't put your hands
on the ends of the tower but on the tested floor and the next one, leaving only the bridge
gaps between them.</p>
<h2>How to tune your printer</h2>
<p>In the case of bad bed adhesion change the temperature in your filament setting
(extruder -> other layers), then save it. Then you can generate a new tower with a different
temperature region as well.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Most of the calibrations need to be done in the <strong>correct</strong> order. This one
should be third.</p>
